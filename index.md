Iâ€™m the first born and reigning princess of the Oinam Family. I was born to [Shanta](https://oinam.com) [Huirem](https://huirem.com) and [Brajeshwar](https://brajeshwar.com) [Oinam](https://oinam.com) in 2008 in Imphal, Manipur (India). I'm also the big sister to our cute little [Amara](https://amara.site/).

I love painting and sketching. I love to play games too. Some of my favorites, at the moment, are Minecraft, FNAF, and Roblox. Actually, I'm fine playing any fun game.
