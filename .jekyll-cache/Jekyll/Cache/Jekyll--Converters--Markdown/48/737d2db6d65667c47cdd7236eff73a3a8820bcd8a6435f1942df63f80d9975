<p>I’m the first born and reigning princess of the Oinam Family. I was born to <a href="https://oinam.mom">Shanta</a> <a href="https://huirem.com">Huirem</a> and <a href="https://brajeshwar.com">Brajeshwar</a> <a href="https://oinam.com">Oinam</a> in 2008 in Imphal, Manipur (India). I’m also the big sister to our cute little <a href="https://amaraoinam.com/">Amara</a>.</p>

<p>I love painting and sketching. I love to play games too. Some of my favorites, at the moment, are Minecraft, FNAF, and Roblox. Actually, I’m fine playing any fun game.</p>

<p>My parents write about our family’s weird, sometimes funny but mostly not-so-funny <a href="https://story.oinam.com">stories</a>.</p>
